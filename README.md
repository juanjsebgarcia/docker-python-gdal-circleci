# docker-python-gdal-circleci
Python + GDAL image built to be run on CircleCI

This is a Python + GEOS package designed to run Django 3.2+ applications. Thus the GEOS packages are limited to the ones supported by Django.

The code is open-source, but the package is used internally by Rumble Travel. For this reason we are likely to refuse any merges.

Please feel free to fork :)
